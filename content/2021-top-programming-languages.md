If you ranked teams in organized sports using the same methods used to generate programming language rankings:

1. Los Angeles Dodgers
2. Kansas City Chiefs
3. Rocket City Trash Pandas
4. University of North Central Missouri State men's baseball team*
5. The India national cricket team
6. The Brooklyn Nets
7. The Canadian Olympic curling team
8. The Miami Marlins
9. The Wichita YMCA men's select basketball team (sponsored by Bernie's Pharmacy)*
10. The Dallas Cowboys

* = may or may not actually exist.

=========

There's always a dozen of these lists that come out every year that purport to tell developers what programming language is currently the most 'valuable'.

They calculate this 'value' in a variety of ways, but largely it comes down to some variation of:

- Number of job posts with that language mentioned
- The salaries reported by people somewhere online, who say they use this language
- Amount of conversation (blog posts, questions, Discord channels, etc.) about that language
- Some proprietary data that the list author has from customers/partners/someone else

They make up some algorithm, throw this stuff in and dump the resulting rankings up to their corporate site or blog.  They may even add some random commentary that adds no value ("Python is popular in data science, I'm sure that means something!").  Their social media people post it everywhere, and they sit back and wait for the inevitable traffic of people who like to argue about this kind of thing (a not-insignificant population!).  Since many of these list authors are companies selling IT-related products or services, they get some nice exposure, and barely have to do anything for it.

These lists suck.

Here's one that was included in the CodeProject newsletter this morning:

Some language called "Solidity" is ranked number 1.

This is the equivalent of the Olympic beach-volleyball duo of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh-Jennings.
