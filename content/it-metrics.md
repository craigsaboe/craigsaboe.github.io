What We Should Measure
ITIL Areas
	- Focus On Value
	- Start Where You Are

	- Levels Of Effort For Obtaining Measurement
		○ Simple
		○ Sophisticated
		○ Complex
	- Measurement Should Be Valuable In Proportion To Level Of Effort
		○ Minor value shouldn't be really hard to get
	- Measurements will build up over time, as people come up with new ones
