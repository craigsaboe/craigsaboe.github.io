"Requirements:
* 7+ years of Full Stack Experience
* 3+ years of Angular [or React or Vue or something front-end]
* 4+ years of "Cloud" Experience
* 6+ years of [something data-related, maybe NoSQL or relational or...]
* [Something about CI/CD pipelines, Git,...]"



After 16 years, I've become more and more convinced that the number one problem with IT hiring is the over-emphasizing of technology stack experience over all other aspects of a candidate.  And the number two problem is using "X years" as some actual metric for skill in a specific technology, as if that has any real correlation to skill.

I've been a manager, and had vet and hire people, too - and it just reinforced my approach.  My evaluation of a candidate is based first around them as a person; then around them as a colleague and teammate; and then around their technical ability.  And when I get to technical ability, I want to see 3 things: they have some level of enthusiasm for technology, they can and have taught themselves new tech when needed, and they have some level of previous experience in IT as appropriate to the position I'm hiring for.  Not '4 years of X' or 'deep understanding of Y' - they have the ability and drive to learn what they need to and have done so in situations challenging enough that I can be confident they can do so again as I need them to.
