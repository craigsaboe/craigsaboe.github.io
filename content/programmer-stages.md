	1. I don't know anything
	2. I know stuff and can see where I can fix things without them being pointed out
	3. Fixing things is hard, I think we should rewrite this!
	4. Rewriting this was fucking stupid, I should have just fixed it!!
	5. Ok, maybe this would have been better as a rewrite looking at it from an overall perspective.
	6. No, no, still, rewrites are not usually a good idea
