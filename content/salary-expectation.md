  PUT YOUR SALARY RANGE ON THE JOB DESCRIPTION. I CAN'T TAKE A $20K PAY CUT EVEN IF I SEE YOUR IN-HOUSE STARBUCKS OR FEEL YOUR "AWESOME CULTURE" FIRST-HAND.  DON'T WASTE MY TIME.

  You have one.  It's written down, approved, budgeted for, and based on your particular setup, pretty firm (I would be a little concerned if you weren't that careful about adding payroll!).  Even if you really, REALLY like me, your CFO/PHB/whatever is probably not going to have another $xx,xxx sitting around for you to hit my number if there's a substantial gap.
  
  Because obviously, I have a number range too.  It's also likely to be pretty firm, because my mortgage company doesn't care whether I really REALLY want to take your job (and its associated $25k pay cut).  So unless your perks include paying said mortgage (if so, call me!!), I will not get approval from MY CFO (she also prefers to pay our bills for whatever reason).  
  
  And in the end, family > job, period - and that big pay cut is both a short and long-term sacrifice I'd be asking of them. Very, very little chance that I will ask that of them, just because I think your position might be more fun for me.
