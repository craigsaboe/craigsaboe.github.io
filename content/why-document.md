Status: draft


(How/what/when are we documenting?  What are the rules/processes for creating and maintaining documentation?  How do we make sure that the documentation is actually useful?  Those types of logistical things.)

Point of the Wiki
	- "Institutional Knowledge"… all the KDG-specific junk floating around inside each of our developers' heads that the rest of us would need to figure out if that developer's head was no longer available
	- Wiki is a low-friction, easy-to-use, straight-foward way to capture as much of that knowledge as we can
	- Flexible free-form search across entire knowledge base
	- everyone can access easily and conveniently

When Are We Documenting:
ANALYSIS
	1. Besides the documentation we add into Zoho Projects, any info that could be helpful should be added to the wiki.
		a. regardless of the research topic, usually, you're going to be looking at how the software is structured, how it works, etc. - might as well make sure that's in the wiki too
	2. Almost every task should require at least a review of existing documentation to make sure anything notable is added, and existing info is updated or verified.

Wiki Rules of Thumb
	1. "Intern Rule": If you would have to explain it to an intern, put it in the wiki.
	2. "You probably should Rule": When in doubt, put it the wiki.
	3. "All Your Content Is Belong To Us! Rule": If there's external content that could be useful, put it (or a link to it) in the wiki.
	4. "Same Zip Code Rule" Do your best to put it somewhere "sensible", but just get it in there.
	

How to get started with the wiki
	- basic structure right off the bat
	- who all is getting it populated to start
	- how will it stay updated, how to make sure!


Stuff To Add?
	- Brainstorming page - ideas, possible future features?

Content Suggestions…
	- General information about a Project, milestones, delivery dates etc.
	- Summaries of design decisions/meetings. Important so that you don't re-visit the same areas time and time again.
	- HowTo guides for general development of current projects (for example, how to develop a new Plugin)
