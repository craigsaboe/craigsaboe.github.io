## SSF
Collection of standards and programs for the secure design and development of payment software
![SSF Overview](/images/pci-ssf/1.png)

## Notes
* Consists of:
    * Security standards for developing and maintaining payment software so that it protects payment transactions and data, minimizes vulnerabilities, and defends against attacks
    * A new methodology for validating software security and a separate secure software lifecycle qualification for vendors with robust security development practices
* Uses "outcome-focused requirements"
    * Provides more agility for developers to incorporate payment application security with nimble development practices and frequent update cycles.

### Assessment
* SSF Assessors evaluate vendors and their payment software products against:
    * the Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard 
    * the Secure Software Standard

### Transition From PA-DSS
* PA-DSS v3.2 expires at the end of October 2022
* It will be formally retired and replaced by the SSF, which provides modern requirements that support a broader array of payment software types, technologies, and development methodologies
