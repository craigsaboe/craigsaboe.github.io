		<div><p>Problem:
    - Want centralized documentation location
        ○ Should be easy to locate as a whole
        ○ Should be searchable - easy to find relevant information within it
        ○ Should be easy to edit and maintain</p>
<p>Proposed Solutions:
    - Azure DevOps Wiki
        ○ Current proposed option
    - Zoho Wiki
        ○ Possible alternative suggested by Craig
    - SharePoint Pages (very wiki-like)
        ○ Possible alternative suggested by Craig</p>
<p>Commonalities
    - All three offer "standard" wiki functionality:
        ○ WYSIWIG and/or rich text editing
        ○ Ability to link between pages and create arbitrary hierarchies
        ○ Integrations with external systems to expedite e.g. referencing Projects or source code
    - (verify) Allows notifications and/or alerts to track changes made to content at some level
    - History functionality allows some level of 'change-tracking', probably rollback if needed</p>
<p>Differences
Azure DevOps Wiki
    - Alberto noted a number of features that make "ADW" advantageous for work in that platform
Advantages
        ○ Different integrations into Azure as a whole
        ○ Keeps docs tightly bound to a given repository
            § Tying these together might force devs to make sure they update related documentation alongside significant code changes?
            § README files can be maintained with Wiki links
Disadvantages
    - Tying documentation directly to a codebase will silo that information specifically to that project
        ○ Not sure how well it works when trying to link to or 'relate' knowledge between projects
        ○ How well does search work when trying to look through wikis for information spanning multiple projects?
    - How difficult does this make sharing info outside the dev team?
        ○ Non-devs would need to access ADW to view and/or edit this, if we wanted to knowledge-share outside dept.; permissions?</p>
<p>SharePoint Pages
Advantages
    - Easier to allow most everybody to contribute to the knowledgebase
        ○ Centralized access management - should be easy to grant most everyone access of some level
        ○ Info about i.e. HACR is centralized, whether it's directly code-based or not; UI info and use cases all linked in one place
        ○ Referencing libraries or other common 'parts' of multiple projects should be much easier
        ○ Centrally locating in SP where a lot of documentation (files, images) already lives should encourage contribution and ease search/discovery of info
Disadvantages
    - Not sure about access yet for everyone
    - Will allowing more universal access cause any 'confusion', too many people modifying/etc.?
    - Is wiki meant to be more project specific, and thus DevOps Wiki would have the advantage?
    - Is tying a wiki more tightly to the Zoho suite (using Zoho Wiki) as opposed to SP more advantageous?</p>
<p>Zoho Wiki
    - I don't have access yet but I have to assume it's largely "SharePoint Pages in Zoho"
    - Might integrate better with Projects, Connect, other Zoho tools?
    - Doesn't seem to get a lot of press on home page or elsewhere on Zoho's site; what is the product's future?
        ○ Could this possibly be sunsetted or possibly require migration at some point?</p></div>
